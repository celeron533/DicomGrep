# DicomGrep

An open source tool for searching Dicom files contents.

In "Just could use" state. No warranty.

## Features
1. Search DICOM by file contents (of course!).
2. Remember 10 search criteria histories.
3. Multi thread search (no more than logic CPU counts)
4. Simple file operations (open directory, open file, etc.)
5. Some unexpected bugs.
